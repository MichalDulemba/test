when would you want to create a repository rather than keeping all you work local

ALWAYS


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic changes would overwrite every change in local repository. It would not make any sense.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - github copy of another repository
Clone - local or github copy of another repository
branch - local copy of repository with some changes

Branch - when working locally
Clone - when you need to download something to work on this locally
Fork - when you want somebodys code on your github account


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can check if your contributors changed anything and then merge your changes with theirs
